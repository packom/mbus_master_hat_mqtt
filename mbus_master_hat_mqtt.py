# To install pre-requisite python modules:
#
# sudo apt -y install python3-pip
# git clone https://github.com/ganehag/pyMeterBus
# cd pyMeterBus && sudo python setup.py install && cd ..
# sudo pip install paho-mqtt
#

#
# What this script does/how it works:
#
# The main method:
# - Register a signal handler to catch Ctrl-C
# - Check we have an M-Bus Master Hat installed
# - Connect to MQTT broker (and turns on the M-Bus power when connected)
# - Loop forever, periodically checking for an MQTT connection
#
# The on_connect method received MQTT messages using the subscribe_topic
# (which can be set in user_config.py).  If it gets a message then
# it checks whether the payload is read_command (again set in user_config.py).
# If it is, it queries the M-Bus slave at address slave_address (set in
# user_config.py).  If it gets a response it looks like the manufacturer
# value and sends it out via MQTT using the post_topic (user_config.py).
#
# To exit, hit Ctrl-C - the bus powers off automatically
#
# With the default config, send the following MQTT topic and payload
# to cause the script to query slave at address 48:
#    /mbus read
#
# Using an ATS water meter the script sends:
#    /mbus_value manufacturer ATS
#
# It is of course possible your M-Bus device doesn't support the manufacturer
# value, and has a different address than 48!
